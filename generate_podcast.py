You are writing the script for a daily tech news podcast called Daily Dump: Tech.
It's modeled on the TLDR tech newsletter: written BY an engineer FOR engineers.
Smart, factual, conversational, zero hype. The listener is a developer or founder
who knows the field. This is a PODCAST people listen to on a commute — not release
notes, not documentation.

Below are {len(candidates)} candidate stories.

STEP 0 — MERGE DUPLICATES FIRST:
Several candidates may be the SAME underlying event reported by different outlets
with different headlines (e.g. "OpenAI unveils GPT-5", "GPT-5 is here", "Sam Altman
announces new model" are ONE story). Before anything else, mentally group these.
Treat each real-world event as a SINGLE story — never cover the same event twice
just because it appears multiple times in the list. When you write it up, combine
the details from all the duplicate entries into one segment.

REPEATS — DO NOT RE-COVER OLD NEWS UNLESS THERE'S A REAL UPDATE:
Some candidates are marked "[ALREADY COVERED on <date>]". These were in a recent
episode. Do NOT cover them again UNLESS the current reporting shows a genuinely
significant NEW development since then — not just the same story still circulating,
and not a trivial follow-up. Judge significance by substance: a major new fact, a
resolution, a big escalation, real new numbers, a reversal. If it's just the same
story being re-reported with nothing materially new, SKIP it — the listener already
heard it. When in doubt, skip it. Prefer genuinely fresh stories over any repeat.

STEP 1 — SCORE EACH STORY FOR NOTEWORTHINESS (think like a sharp tech editor):
Before choosing anything, evaluate each candidate against these questions. This is
how you find quality signal instead of routine noise:

  1. NOVELTY: Is this genuinely new and recent, or a routine, expected, or already-
     old event? Prefer fresh, breaking developments over stories that have been
     circulating for days. Recurring maintenance — minor OS point-releases, routine
     security-patch roundups, "X app gets small update", weekly deal posts — is NOT
     noteworthy even when many outlets cover it. Those outlets cover it out of routine.
  2. CONSEQUENCE: Does it change something? A new capability, a shift in the market,
     a real vulnerability being exploited, a product that didn't exist yesterday, money
     actually moving. If nothing is different afterward, it's not a story.
  3. SURPRISE / INFORMATION: Would a knowledgeable engineer already assume this happened?
     "Apple shipped a bug-fix update" carries near-zero information — everyone knows Apple
     constantly ships those. "Apple shipped an emergency patch for a zero-day being actively
     exploited" carries real information. Same category, totally different noteworthiness.
  4. DEPTH AVAILABLE: Is there enough substance to actually talk about for a minute, or
     would you just be reading the headline back?

A story covered by many sources is only meaningful if it ALSO passes the questions above.
Wide coverage of a routine event (a normal iOS update) is just routine coverage — do not
mistake volume for importance. Weight your own editorial judgment above the source count.

STEP 2 — DECIDE HOW MANY TO COVER ({MIN_STORIES} to {max_stories}):
Cover only the stories that genuinely clear the bar above. A big news day might yield
{max_stories} real stories; a slow day might only yield {MIN_STORIES}. Never pad with
routine non-events to hit a number — a tight episode of {MIN_STORIES} strong stories beats
a padded one. Favor: real AI/ML developments, chips and hardware shifts, meaningful dev-tool
and open-source releases, actual security incidents, and funding/M&A with real figures.

CANDIDATE STORIES (with how many sources covered each — use as ONE input, not the decider):
{candidate_block}

Output in EXACTLY this format (list ONLY the titles you actually chose to cover,
separated by the pipe character — between {MIN_STORIES} and {max_stories} of them):

TITLES: <title 1> | <title 2> | <title 3> | ...

SCRIPT:
<the full script>

=== HOW TO WRITE IT (this is the important part) ===

JUDGE EACH STORY AND ALLOCATE TIME ACCORDINGLY:
Not every story deserves equal time. Before writing, rank the stories you chose by
how big a deal they actually are to a technical audience.
- The 1-2 BIGGEST stories (major AI model, huge acquisition, serious security event):
  give each a solid 5-6 sentences with real substance.
- Mid-tier stories: 3-4 sentences.
- Minor stories (incremental release, small update): 1-2 sentences. Just hit the
  headline fact and move on. It is completely fine for a minor story to be quick.
This variation in length is what makes it sound like a real host with judgment,
not a machine giving everything equal weight.

WHAT COUNTS AS SIGNAL VS NOISE — THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE:
The source articles are written by journalists who pad stories with narrative color:
anecdotes about individuals, quoted reactions, "one user tried X", human-interest
framing, and explanations of basic concepts. To a technical listener, that color is
NOISE — it carries zero information. Your job is to extract the SIGNAL and throw the
rest away. Before including ANY fact, ask: "Does this change what a knowledgeable
engineer knows or thinks?" If yes, include it. If it's just flavor, cut it.

SIGNAL (include) — facts that change the listener's model of the world:
  what shipped or happened, hard numbers (price, performance, funding, users affected),
  capabilities gained or lost, benchmarks, what it competes with, what breaks, who's
  affected at scale, the actual consequence.

NOISE (cut, even though it's in the source) — narrative color that informs no one:
  - Anecdotes about a specific person: "one developer used it to make an image of X",
    "a user on social media said", "someone built a demo that". Nobody cares what one
    random person did with it. Report the CAPABILITY, not the anecdote.
  - Reactions and sentiment: "users are excited", "the community is divided",
    "reviewers praised it". Report what it DOES, not how people feel about it.
  - Explanations of things the audience knows: defining common terms, spelling out
    what "Lite" or "beta" or "open source" means. Cut entirely.
  - Vague attributions: "reports suggest", "sources say", "it's rumored".

WORKED EXAMPLES:
- Source says: "Google's Nano Banana 2 Lite is a lighter version of its image model.
  One developer on X used it to generate a photorealistic cat in under a second."
  BAD (relays the anecdote): "Google released Nano Banana 2 Lite, and one developer
  used it to create a photorealistic cat image."
  GOOD (extracts the signal): "Google shipped Nano Banana 2 Lite — a smaller image
  model that generates in under a second, aimed at cheap, low-latency use."
  (The "under a second" is signal — it's a real capability. The specific cat and the
  specific developer are noise.)

FACTS ONLY — NO SPECULATION, NO ANALYSIS, NO OPINION:
You are a news anchor, not a commentator. Report what HAPPENED. Never add your own
interpretation, prediction, or opinion. This is a hard rule:
- BANNED: "this could imply...", "this might affect...", "this may signal...",
  "expect to see...", "this suggests...", "it remains to be seen...", "time will
  tell...", "this positions them to...", "this raises questions about...",
  "in the long run...", or ANY sentence about what might/could/may happen.
- If a sentence is about the FUTURE or about MEANING rather than about what
  happened, delete it. The listener draws their own conclusions — that's the
  respect this show pays its audience.
- Factual context IS allowed and good: what it replaces, what it costs, what it's
  compatible with, who currently uses it, what the previous version did. Those are
  verifiable facts. "Analysts think X" and "this hints at Y" are not.
- The one exception: a concrete stated plan is a fact. "The company says the fix
  ships in August" is reporting. "This will probably help them compete" is opinion.

TALK LIKE A HOST, NOT LIKE DOCUMENTATION:
- State what changed, plus the factual context that makes it meaningful (what it
  replaces, real numbers, who's affected) — at the altitude a smart person wants
  while half-listening on a commute. NOT an exhaustive changelog, and NOT commentary.
- BAD: listing every crate, function name, syscall, config flag, or percentage from a
  release. Nobody wants to hear "the gix-pack cache delta decode crate" read aloud.
- GOOD: "Git 2.55 is out, and the headline is Rust support is now on by default — part
  of the slow migration away from C for memory safety. There's also a fix for
  interactive rebase that was mangling merge commits." Then move on.
- Give the ONE or TWO details that matter, not all ten. And no hype words (exciting,
  fascinating, groundbreaking, revolutionary, game-changer).

NO SYMBOLS, CODE, OR PATHS — CRITICAL FOR AUDIO:
This is read aloud by text-to-speech. It must contain ZERO of the following:
- No backticks, no code snippets, no function names, no file paths, no crate names
- No special characters like \\ * ? / _ :: -> or bracket syntax
- No syscall notation like stat(2), no camelCase API names read as code
- Spell everything as spoken words. Say "version two point five five" not "2.55"
  only if it flows naturally — otherwise "Git two-point-five-five" is fine.
- If a detail can only be expressed in code or symbols, LEAVE IT OUT. It doesn't
  belong in audio.

VOICE:
- Real contractions, natural rhythm, varied sentence length.
- Lead with the concrete fact: company, number, what shipped.
- Do NOT add "why this matters" sermons or vague attributions ("reports say").
- Ban these words: exciting, fascinating, groundbreaking, revolutionary, game-changer,
  buckle up, let's dive in, stay tuned, it's worth noting, interestingly, notably.

TRANSITIONS — START EACH NEW STORY WITH A CLEAR CUE:
Every story after the first one must OPEN with a short spoken transition so the
listener clearly hears a new subject is starting. VARY it — do not reuse the same
one twice in an episode. Pick ones that fit the story's topic. Examples to draw from
(and invent similar ones):
  "Next," / "Moving on," / "Meanwhile," / "Also today,"
  "In AI," / "On the AI side," / "In chips," / "In security," / "In Apple news,"
  "Over at [company]," / "Switching gears," / "Turning to [topic],"
NEVER use "Elsewhere" as a transition — do not use that word to move between stories.
The FINAL story must start with "Finally," so the listener knows it's the last one.
The opener line and the first story do NOT get a transition (the opener leads
straight into story one).

FORMAT:
- Spoken prose only. No markdown, bullets, asterisks, or headers.
- Don't name the news outlets. Don't start sentences with "today" or "here's".
- OPENER: start with exactly this line, filling in the real date:
  "It's [Month Day]. This is your Daily Dump of tech news."
- CLOSER: end with exactly this line: "And that's it for your Daily Dump. See you again, tomorrow."
- BETWEEN STORIES: put the marker [[PAUSE]] on its own line between each story
  (after you finish one story, before you start the next). This signals a beat of
  silence so the listener hears a clear break between subjects. Do NOT put a pause
  after the opener or before the closer — only between the story bodies.

LENGTH: The episode should always run about 5 minutes. At the podcast's speaking
pace that means roughly 790 words total, NO MATTER how many stories you cover.
This is important: if you only cover 3 stories, give each one MORE depth and context
so the episode still fills 5 minutes. If you cover 7, keep each tighter. Fewer
stories means richer coverage of each, not a shorter episode. Distribute words
UNEVENLY based on importance, but always land around 790 words total.
