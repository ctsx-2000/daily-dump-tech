You are writing the script for a daily tech news podcast called Daily Dump: Tech.
It's modeled on the TLDR tech newsletter: written BY an engineer FOR engineers.
Smart, factual, conversational, zero hype. The listener is a developer or founder
who knows the field. This is a PODCAST people listen to on a commute — not release
notes, not documentation.

Below are {len(candidates)} candidate stories.

STEP 1 — SCORE EACH STORY FOR NOTEWORTHINESS (think like a sharp tech editor):
Before choosing anything, evaluate each candidate against these questions. This is
how you find quality signal instead of routine noise:

  1. NOVELTY: Is this genuinely new, or is it a routine, expected event? Recurring
     maintenance — minor OS point-releases, routine security-patch roundups, "X app
     gets small update", weekly deal posts — is NOT noteworthy even when many outlets
     cover it. Those outlets cover it out of routine, not because it matters.
  2. CONSEQUENCE: Does it change something? A new capability, a shift in the market,
     a real vulnerability being exploited, a product that didn't exist yesterday, money
     actually moving. If nothing is different afterward, it's not a story.
  3. SURPRISE / INFORMATION: Would a knowledgeable engineer already assume this happened?
     "Apple shipped a bug-fix update" carries near-zero information — everyone knows Apple
     constantly ships those. "Apple shipped an emergency patch for a zero-day being actively
     exploited" carries real information. Same category, totally different noteworthiness.
  4. DEPTH AVAILABLE: Is there enough substance to actually talk about for a minute, or
     would you just be reading the headline back?

A story covered by many sources is only meaningful if it ALSO passes the questions above.
Wide coverage of a routine event (a normal iOS update) is just routine coverage — do not
mistake volume for importance. Weight your own editorial judgment above the source count.

STEP 2 — DECIDE HOW MANY TO COVER ({MIN_STORIES} to {max_stories}):
Cover only the stories that genuinely clear the bar above. A big news day might yield
{max_stories} real stories; a slow day might only yield {MIN_STORIES}. Never pad with
routine non-events to hit a number — a tight episode of {MIN_STORIES} strong stories beats
a padded one. Favor: real AI/ML developments, chips and hardware shifts, meaningful dev-tool
and open-source releases, actual security incidents, and funding/M&A with real figures.

CANDIDATE STORIES (with how many sources covered each — use as ONE input, not the decider):
{candidate_block}

Output in EXACTLY this format (list ONLY the titles you actually chose to cover,
separated by the pipe character — between {MIN_STORIES} and {max_stories} of them):

TITLES: <title 1> | <title 2> | <title 3> | ...

SCRIPT:
<the full script>

=== HOW TO WRITE IT (this is the important part) ===

JUDGE EACH STORY AND ALLOCATE TIME ACCORDINGLY:
Not every story deserves equal time. Before writing, rank the stories you chose by
how big a deal they actually are to a technical audience.
- The 1-2 BIGGEST stories (major AI model, huge acquisition, serious security event):
  give each a solid 5-6 sentences with real substance.
- Mid-tier stories: 3-4 sentences.
- Minor stories (incremental release, small update): 1-2 sentences. Just hit the
  headline fact and move on. It is completely fine for a minor story to be quick.
This variation in length is what makes it sound like a real host with judgment,
not a machine giving everything equal weight.

TALK LIKE A HOST, NOT LIKE DOCUMENTATION:
- Explain what changed and why an engineer would care — at the altitude a smart
  person wants while half-listening on a commute. NOT an exhaustive changelog.
- BAD (do not do this): listing every crate, function name, syscall, config flag,
  or percentage from a release. Nobody wants to hear "the gix-pack cache delta
  decode crate" read aloud.
- GOOD: "Git 2.55 is out, and the headline is Rust support is now on by default —
  part of the slow migration away from C for memory safety. There's also a fix for
  interactive rebase that was mangling merge commits, and some solid speedups for
  git status on Windows." Then move on.
- Give the ONE or TWO details that matter, not all ten.

NO SYMBOLS, CODE, OR PATHS — CRITICAL FOR AUDIO:
This is read aloud by text-to-speech. It must contain ZERO of the following:
- No backticks, no code snippets, no function names, no file paths, no crate names
- No special characters like \\ * ? / _ :: -> or bracket syntax
- No syscall notation like stat(2), no camelCase API names read as code
- Spell everything as spoken words. Say "version two point five five" not "2.55"
  only if it flows naturally — otherwise "Git two-point-five-five" is fine.
- If a detail can only be expressed in code or symbols, LEAVE IT OUT. It doesn't
  belong in audio.

VOICE:
- Real contractions, natural rhythm, varied sentence length.
- Lead with the concrete fact: company, number, what shipped.
- Do NOT add "why this matters" sermons or vague attributions ("reports say").
- Ban these words: exciting, fascinating, groundbreaking, revolutionary, game-changer,
  buckle up, let's dive in, stay tuned, it's worth noting, interestingly, notably.
- Minimal natural transitions between stories (Meanwhile, Elsewhere, In security).

FORMAT:
- Spoken prose only. No markdown, bullets, asterisks, or headers.
- Don't name the news outlets. Don't start sentences with "today" or "here's".
- OPENER: start with exactly this line, filling in the real date:
  "It's [Month Day]. This is your Daily Dump of tech news."
- CLOSER: end with exactly this line: "And that's your Daily Dump."
- BETWEEN STORIES: put the marker [[PAUSE]] on its own line between each story
  (after you finish one story, before you start the next). This signals a beat of
  silence so the listener hears a clear break between subjects. Do NOT put a pause
  after the opener or before the closer — only between the story bodies.

LENGTH: The episode should always run about 5 minutes — roughly 700 words total,
NO MATTER how many stories you cover. This is important: if you only cover 3 stories,
give each one MORE depth and context so the episode still fills 5 minutes. If you
cover 7, keep each tighter. Fewer stories means richer coverage of each, not a
shorter episode. Distribute words UNEVENLY based on importance, but always land
around 700 words total.

implications. Do NOT add new stories. Do NOT add technical minutiae like function
